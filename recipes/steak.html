    <h2>Juicy, tender, and full of bold flavor</h2>
        <p>This steak is pan-seared to perfection with a crispy 
        crust and a melt-in-your-mouth center.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 thick-cut steak 
                (e.g., ribeye, sirloin, or filet mignon)</li>
                <li>Salt</li>
                <li>1-2 tbsp olive oil or a high smoke-point oil</li>
                <li>2-3 garlic cloves, smashed</li>
                <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter (for basting)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Take the steak out of the fridge and let it rest at room temperature for about 20-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season both sides generously with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
                <li>Heat a heavy skillet (preferably cast iron) over high heat until very hot. Add a tablespoon of oil.</li>
                <li>Sear the steak for 1 minute on each side to develop a crust.</li>
                <li>Continue cooking the steak for 3-4 more minutes, flipping it every minute for even cooking.</li>
                <li>In the last 2 minutes of cooking, reduce the heat to medium and add butter, smashed garlic, and herbs (optional).</li>
                <li>Baste the steak by spooning the melted butter over the top continuously for 1 minute, then flip and repeat on the other side.</li>
                <li>Remove the steak from the pan and wrap it loosely in foil. Let it rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
            </ol>
